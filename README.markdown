## Overview

The google_auth_proxy module allows you to set up and manage instances of the [bitly Google OAuth2 proxy](https://github.com/bitly/google_auth_proxy) with minimal effort.

## Module Description

[google_auth_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/google_auth_proxy) is an HTTP Reverse Proxy that provides authentication using [Googleâ€™s OAuth2 API](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2) with flexibility to authorize individual Google Accounts (by email address) or a whole Google apps domain. Read more about it in [this blog post](http://word.bitly.com/post/47548678256/google-auth-proxy) and see detailed instructions on [github](https://github.com/bitly/google_auth_proxy).

This module makes it easy to deploy a proxy for an existing application.

This module was developed for, and only tested on, CentOS 7.

It was also developed for use in an AWS environment with SSL termination at the ELB, ie. there is no provision to set up ```https``` proxies. I may add this at some stage in the future. PRs welcome. :)

## Architecture

Taken from the google_auth_proxy [README](https://github.com/bitly/google_auth_proxy/blob/master/README.md):

```
    _______       ___________________       __________
    |Nginx| ----> |google_auth_proxy| ----> |upstream| 
    -------       -------------------       ----------
                          ||
                          \/
                  [google oauth2 api]
```

## Setup

### What google_auth_proxy affects

* google_auth_proxy itself is a single, self-contained executable
* nginx is installed and configured as a front end to the proxy
* a service instance is created to run the proxy

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

Make a note of the IP/hostname and port on which your application is running. Typically the proxy and application would run on the same node with the application bound to a high-numbered port and listening on localhost.

Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/bitly/google_auth_proxy/blob/master/README.md) to set up your OAuth configuration with Google and make a note of your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

The google_auth_proxy RPM should be made available in a yum repo that has been configured on the target system. Both source and binary RPMs are available in [my yum repo](http://repo.yo61.net/el/7/).

Sample puppet code to configure the repo:
```puppet
yumrepo{'yo61':
  ensure   => present,
  name     => 'yo61',
  baseurl  => "http://repo.yo61.net/el/${::operatingsystemmajrelease}/${::architecture}/RPMS",
  enabled  => 1,
  gpgcheck => 1,
  gpgkey   => 'http://repo.yo61.net/RPM-GPG-KEY-YO61',
}
```

### Beginning with google_auth_proxy

Creating the proxy is as simple as this:
```puppet
  $app_url = 'https://your_app.example.com',
  $auth_domains = ['your_domain.com']
  $upstreams = ['http://localhost:8080']
  $cookie_secret = <seed string for secure cookies>
  $client_id = <your client id>
  $client_secret = <your client secret>

  google_auth_proxy{'puppetboard_stage':
    redirect_url        => $app_url,
    google_apps_domains => $auth_domains,
    upstreams           => $upstreams,
    cookie_secret       => $cookie_secret,
    client_id           => $client_id,
    client_secret       => $client_secret,
  }
```
This will create a nginx vhost listening on port 80 on all IP addresses with the proxy app listening on port 4180 on localhost.
## Usage

###Classes and Defined Types

**Parameters within `google_auth_proxy`:**
#####`ensure`
#####`redirect_url`
#####`google_apps_domains`
#####`upstreams`
#####`cookie_secret`
#####`client_id`
#####`client_secret`
#####`proxy_host = '*'`
#####`proxy_port = '80'`
#####`proxy_connect_timeout = '1'`
#####`proxy_read_timeout = '30'`
#####`gap_host = 'localhost'`
#####`gap_port = '4180'`
#####`gap_upstream_fail_timeout = '10s'`
#####`user = 'root'`
#####`group = 'root'`

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module. This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should consider using changelog). You may also add any additional sections you feel are necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.
